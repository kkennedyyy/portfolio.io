    <p id ="aboutme">
     It's crazy the numerous things people can build with an Arduino Kit. I once saw someone build Thanos hand and controlled it with one! It's crazy, but that's exactly why I fell in love with coding 
     due to numerous projects my sophomre year of high school using an Arduino Kit. This intricate board caused me to seek other opportunities and led me to Girls Who Code, where I learned numerous languages 
     like CSS, HTML, and Java. From that day on, I fell in love with coding and the versatility of it. Throughout high school I took AP computer classes, joined my school's robotics team, and won the 
     Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship that allowed me to intern at Amazon after my first year of college. While at my internship in Seattle, I've gained numerous development, design, and testing skills along 
     with experience of a typical day in a corporate setting.
